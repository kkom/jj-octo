A description edited on GitHub is written into the change, one edited locally is sent to the pull request, and edits on both sides are merged line by line. That holds for a local edit pushed with `jj git push` too, since submit records the description that both sides last agreed on in `jj-octo/pr-descriptions` under the repository's `.jj/repo`, in the main workspace. Edits to the same lines stop the submit before anything is pushed.",
    "First, where any of those changes' pull requests merged or any of their branches changed on GitHub, syncs their stack as `jj gh sync` does, and leaves other stacks alone. That drops the merged changes, takes what GitHub added to the branches, and rebases the rest onto the trunk, so the push doesn't undo GitHub's work.",

    "If changes were reordered, inserted or dropped since the last submit, the GitHub stack is dissolved and registered again under a new number. The pull requests stay open, including the one of a dropped change.",
